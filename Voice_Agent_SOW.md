## The Challenge Every Business Faces

Every day, potential customers call your business. But what happens when:

- It's after 5 PM and your team has gone home
- Your front desk is helping someone in person
- It's Saturday morning and you're closed
- Call volume spikes and lines are busy

**The answer is simple: those customers go elsewhere.**

Research shows that **85% of callers who reach voicemail will not call back**. They'll simply call your competitor who answers.

> "We were losing 30-40% of our after-hours inquiries to competitors. We had no idea until we started tracking it."
> _--- Hotel General Manager_

## The Solution: An Assistant That Never Sleeps

Our AI-powered voice assistant answers your calls **24 hours a day, 7 days a week**. It doesn't just take messages. It handles complete transactions: answering questions, checking availability, and booking appointments.

Your customers get immediate service. Your team stays focused on in-person guests. Your business captures revenue around the clock.

### Your Numbers May Be Different

The example above is conservative. Consider your specific situation:

| If You Receive... | And Miss... | At Average Value... | Monthly Loss |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| 15 calls/day      | 25%         | $75                 | **$843**     |
| 20 calls/day      | 30%         | $100                | **$1,800**   |
| 30 calls/day      | 35%         | $125                | **$3,937**   |
| 50 calls/day      | 30%         | $150                | **$6,750**   |

**The question isn't whether you can afford an AI assistant. It's whether you can afford not to have one.**

## Addressing Your Concerns

### "Will customers know they're talking to AI?"

The assistant sounds natural and conversational. In our experience, customers appreciate getting immediate help rather than waiting on hold or leaving a voicemail. Most don't ask whether they're speaking with a person. They care about getting their question answered or their booking made.

### "What if a customer has a complex question?"

You set the rules. The assistant can:

- Transfer to staff when someone is available
- Take a detailed message for callback
- Escalate urgent matters immediately
- Provide your direct number for sensitive issues

For questions outside its knowledge, it responds honestly: _"I want to make sure you get accurate information on that. Let me take your number and have someone call you back within the hour."_

### "What if my internet or phone system goes down?"

The system has built-in redundancy:

- If internet fails, calls automatically route to a backup voicemail
- You receive an immediate alert
- Service resumes the moment connection returns
- No calls are ever simply dropped

### "Can it integrate with my booking system?"

Yes. We integrate with:

- Property Management Systems (Opera, Cloudbeds, Guesty, etc.)
- Scheduling software (Calendly, Acuity, Jane App, etc.)
- CRM systems (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.)
- Custom databases via API

### "How do I update pricing or services?"

Contact us anytime. Updates are made remotely within 24 hours, usually same-day. No site visits required.

### "What happens to call recordings?"

All calls are logged and available in your dashboard. Recordings are encrypted and stored securely. You have full access to review any conversation.

## Start With Zero Risk

<div align="center">

![30-Day Free Trial](assets/trial-offer.svg)

</div>

### How the Trial Works

1. **We set everything up** at no cost
2. **You use the service** for 30 days
3. **We provide a detailed report** showing:
   - Total calls handled
   - Bookings captured
   - Revenue generated
   - Calls that would have been missed
4. **You decide** if the value justifies the investment

There's no credit card required. No obligation to continue. If it doesn't work for your business, you've lost nothing.

> "We were skeptical, but the trial proved itself. In the first month, the AI booked 47 reservations we would have missed. That's over $6,000 in revenue from calls we weren't even answering before."
> _--- Boutique Hotel Owner_
